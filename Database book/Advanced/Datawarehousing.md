## **Project Overview**

* **Objective:** Create a **Database Management System (DBMS)** for a company (or startup) based on **information you gather from them**.
* **Outcome:** At the end of the course, you will **submit documentation** of your project and do a **defense/presentation**.

## **Step-by-Step Tasks**

### **1. Field Visit / Data Gathering**

* Visit the company/organization you are assigned to.
* Observe:

  * How they run their facility/office operations.
  * How they collect, store, and use their data.
  * How processes flow in their environment.
* **Goal:** Understand their existing system (if any) or collect enough information to build a DBMS from scratch.

### **2. Conduct Interviews**

* Interview relevant staff in the company.
* Gather information such as:

  * Names of entities (e.g., employees, products, clients)
  * Relationships between entities
  * How they process data
* **Responsibilities:**

  * Manage the interview process
  * Take notes and document all responses

### **3. Database Design**

* Using the data collected:

  * Identify **entities** and **relationships**
  * Design the database structure (tables, attributes, keys, relationships)
  * Consider how to **query** and **manage** the data

* **Remember:**

  * Multiple entities may exist, and relationships must be correctly modeled
  * Use the **methods discussed in class** to design the DBMS

### **4. Reporting & Documentation**

* Document every step:

  * Name of the company
  * Data gathered from observations and interviews
  * Database design (ER diagrams, table structures, relationships)
  * Queries or operations for managing the DBMS
* Format:

  * You can research standard project documentation formats
  * Include title page, introduction, methodology, results, conclusions, etc.
* **Why:** Documentation is required for submission and record-keeping

### **5. Submission & Defense**

* At the end of the course:

  * Submit the project **documentation**
  * Prepare to **defend** your project (explain your design choices, data collection, and how the DBMS works)

### **Additional Tips**

* Work in teams, as instructed
* Try to also learn from companies that already have existing databases
* This project will **help in your industrial training**, giving practical exposure
